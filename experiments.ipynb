      "Answer :  The Pandavas and Kauravas fought in the epic battle of Kurukshetra, as described in the Mahabharata. The main reason for this battle was a dispute over the throne of Hastinapura, the kingdom ruled by the Kauravas.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story goes that the Pandavas, five brothers (Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva), were the sons of King Pandu, the rightful ruler of Hastinapura. However, due to a curse, Pandu was forced to abdicate the throne, and his brother, Dhritarashtra, who was blind, took over as the ruler.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dhritarashtra had 100 sons, known as the Kauravas, with the eldest son, Duryodhana, being the most prominent. Duryodhana was jealous of the Pandavas and feared that they would take over the throne. He conspired against them and tried to kill them several times, but they always managed to escape.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually, the Pandavas were forced to flee to the forest and live in exile for 13 years. When they returned, they demanded their rightful share of the kingdom, but Duryodhana refused to give it to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "This led to a series of negotiations and attempts at peace, but ultimately, war became inevitable. The two armies clashed at Kurukshetra, resulting in one of the most epic battles in Hindu mythology.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pandavas were fighting for their rightful claim to the throne, as well as for justice and dharma (righteousness), while the Kauravas were fighting to maintain their power and control over the kingdom. The war was a struggle between good and evil, with the Pandavas representing the forces of good and the Kauravas representing the forces of evil.\n",
